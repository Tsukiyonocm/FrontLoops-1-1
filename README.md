Version 1.0.0 
This version is not yet responsive. This is a work in progress as there are still a few things I need to fix in this for it to be completed to my standards. I largely just wanted to move on to some of the other challenges in order to move along progression a bit. I shall keep a note of changes that need done still for the future.

Needed Updates:
1. Responsiveness needs updated. Currently the actual cards will be responsive, but the background of the whole area does not work correctly. I need to go and add some media queries to probably correct this issue. 
<br>
2. The titles of each card are currently only inline with one another because I am using a hack to add extra margin to the two that are currently too high (2 and 3). There is a way to fix this with Javascript though I still need to figure out how the code works.
